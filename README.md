### üöÄ Deployment

#### **Local Production Build**

You can serve the frontend from the Express server.

1.  Navigate into the `client` directory: `cd client`
2.  Build the client: `npm run build`
3.  The server will automatically serve the `/client/dist` directory.

#### **Render (or similar PaaS)**

The project includes a script to prepare for production deployment.

```bash
npm run setup-production-app
```

This command installs dependencies, builds the client, and sets up the server to serve the static files, making it ready for deployment on platforms like Render.
